# sahilp-plugins

All Bombsquad plugins specific to the SahilP TeaMs in-game server, usable through
[plugin-manager](https://github.com/bombsquad-community/plugin-manager).

## How does this work?

- If you have the plugin-manager installed in your game, simply go to the category selection pop-up window and add
  `rikkolovescats/sahilp-plugins` as a plugin source. Press refresh and plugins from this repository will now be visible!
- The plugin-manager expects a [category.json](https://github.com/rikkolovescats/sahilp-plugins/blob/main/category.json)
  file for all 3rd party plugin sources. This file acts as a metadata source for all the plugins present in the repository.
  Please refer to it if you're interested in creating your own 3rd party plugin source.
- This README file is a reference for modders wanting to setup their own 3rd plugin source and is not mandatory.
